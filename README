Simulator for poisson arrival people to vaccinate with lambda with M different vaccines and service time is poisson with mu.
rules:
- if no one is vaccinated - pick one vaccine uniformly from M vaccines
- if there is allready someone inside getting vaccine, the arrived customer will take same vaccine
- if there is some people inside in q, they neccerely take the same vaccine and the arrived customer will take same vaccine as well

input:
T - time units limit 
M - num of different vaccines
lambda - rate of customer arrival
mu - rate of service time (time t give the vaccine)
P0,...,Pn - probabbilty for new customer to stay while there is i customers in queue (n is not limited) *(neccerily P0 = 1 , Pn = 0)

output:
Y - num of customer served
X - num of customer left because of line
T' - time last vaccine given 
T_0 - time there was no people in hospital
T_i - avg time for all queues (for each vaccine) there was i people in queue
Z_0 - probabbilty for 0 people want to vaccinate
Z_i - probabbilty for i people want to vaccinate
T_w - avg wait time for customer
T_s - avg service time
mean_kambda - avg rate of customer arrival
